# Backend

This folder contains the Express API written in TypeScript and running with [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

## Development

Install dependencies and start the server:

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

The API is documented with **Swagger**. Once the server is running, the documentation is available at `http://localhost:3000/docs`.
